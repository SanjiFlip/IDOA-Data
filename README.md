# IDOA-Data: Benchmark Test Sets for Algorithm Evaluation

This repository provides benchmark datasets used in the evaluation of the **Improved Dingo Optimization Algorithm (IDOA)**, as described in our manuscript:

> *Improved Dingo Optimization Algorithm with Multi-Disturbance Mechanism for 3D Underwater Wireless Sensor Network Coverage Optimization*  
> (Under review at Scientific Reports)

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `cec2017*/`: Includes all functions from the CEC2017 single-objective benchmark suite.  
- `CEC2022*/`: Includes all functions from the CEC2022 benchmark test set.

Each folder contains:
- MATLAB `.m` files or `.mat` data for function definitions and test problem parameters.
- README files within subfolders (if applicable) for function descriptions and usage.

## 📌 Notes

- This repository **does not** include the source code of the IDOA algorithm.
- For implementation details of IDOA, please refer to the corresponding manuscript.
- If you need additional information regarding the algorithm implementation, you may contact the authors.
